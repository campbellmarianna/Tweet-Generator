At the end of this project add a section to the bottom of your README titled Learning Outcomes with a subtitle What have I done with content styled as a bulleted list that includes:
- master Python data structures and data processing algorithms
- implement data structures including linked lists, hash tables, stacks, queues and heaps
- parse text documents and store information in data structures
implement sampling methods and Markov chains on data sets

"Take a moment to read through these learning outcomes and make a note of how much you already know about each one. You'll look back at this when you are done with the tutorial." - Page 1 in tutorial
- master Python data structures and data processing algorithms (primitive data structures include strings, numbers, booleans, and null)
- implement data structures including linked lists, hash tables, stacks, queues and heaps (lists are just like arrays)
- parse text documents and store information in data structures (let's say you have a doc with a list of words, once you access the file with its name you have to you .read() to read over it and .split to get one line of words I think, this idea was generated from past memories of the Spaceman project)
implement sampling methods and Markov chains on data sets (methods are functions within a class or object(in JS))
