# Tweet Generator

To learn more about data structures and algorithms I will be completing the following guided project tutorial:

-   [Tweet Generator: Data Structures & Probability with Python](http://make.sc/oa-tweet-generator)

## What will I be doing:
- Using a Python script to randomly generate words from a dictionary.
- Building sentences by sampling these words using a Markov language model.
- Implementing grammar rules parsed from the text of a large document set.
- Building data structures including linked lists, hash tables, stacks, queues, and heaps to store the words and sentences.
- Analyzing the inner workings and performance tradeoffs of each data structure.
- Deploying your language model to a Flask web server on Heroku and connect it to Twitter to let users tweet their favorite results.
